DBIx-BlackBox

DBIx::BlackBox - access database with stored procedures only

SYNOPSIS
    DBIx::BlackBox provides access to database using stored procedures only
    (the only SQL command available is *exec*). That allows to treat your
    database as a black box into which only the database administrator
    provides access by stored procedures.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

Sybase and FreeTDS INSTALLATION
    Following installation steps were tested with both Microsoft SQL Server
    2000 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008.

  unixODBC
    Install unixODBC from your system packages or download sources from
    <http://www.unixodbc.org/>.

  FreeTDS
    Download dev release of FreeTDS from <http://www.freetds.org> (tested
    with freetds-0.83.dev.20100122).

        ./configure --with-unixodbc=/usr/local/ \
            --with-tdsver=8.0 --prefix=/usr/local/freetds
        make
        sudo make install

    Edit /usr/local/freetds/etc/freetds.conf and specify access to your
    database.

        ...
        [sqlserver]
            host = 1.2.3.4
            port = 1433
            tds version = 8.0

  DBD::Sybase
    Install DBD::Sybase.

        SYBASE=/usr/local/freetds perl Makefile.PL
        make
        sudo make install

    If you want to test DBD::Sybase most likely you would need to modify
    tests that come with the module (some queries in test files will not
    work with MS SQL Server).
